# μMIPS
##### A Single-Cycle 16 Bit MIPS Processor
&nbsp;
µMIPS is a simplified MIPS architecture with a native word size of 16-bits. That is, the instructions and data values are 16-bits wide. µMIPS immediates can be both unsigned and signed using two’s complement. The processor is made up of many subcircuits: The Program Counter (PC), The Register File, The Arithmatic Logic Unit (ALU), Field Splitter, Instuction Decoder, and an LED Display.
